# NetNanny - (If you see this text I'm currently setting up repository)
<p style="text-align: center;">This program gives the ability to monitor the network by Idletime with Zabbix and Graphana</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<nbsp>This project originally was a solution to address attendence. Some employees did not clock-in or clock-out and the office management wanted to find a way to know when people signed into their computers and when they left for the day.
<br>
Not only that they also wanted to get email alerts when these employees logged in and out of their PCs.
